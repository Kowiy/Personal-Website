        <!-- About Me -->
        Having studied Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen, Germany.
        I participated in several Environmental Protection and climate change awareness programs
        and I've worked as a research assistant at the Prestigious Alfred Wegener Institute
        of Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with groups of scientists to simulate the climate of Cretaceous period,
        by employing Earth System Climate models. This involved writing programs in Python, Fortran as well as shell scripting.
        This exposed me to interactive and innovative use of computer programs in solving complex problems,
        thus, increasing my interest in computer programming technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon relocation to Ontario, I decided to undertake a diploma in Computer Programming
        at Algonquin College, Pembroke, a college well known for applied learning and hands
        on learning experiences, where I have acquired skills in web programming, Object Oriented programming,
        as well as Database and Operating Systems.
